    "In this exercise, we will use $\\texttt{galpy}$ to investigate the gravitational potential of dark matter profiles in dwarf galaxies using the Jeans equations formulation for collisionless systems. We will use mock data based on [Walker et al. (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...704.1274W/abstract). Dwarf galaxies are $>90\\%$ dark matter, so we can assume the gravitational potential is only given by dark matter density profile."

    "(1) After selecting one of the galaxies, define an NFW and Burkert potential in $\\texttt{galpy}$ and plot the corresponding density profiles in a range of 10 to 2000 pc. Taking the previous example, you can use $\\texttt{NFW.dens(r,0)}$ to evaluate the density of the given potential at different distances $r$. Use at least 3 values of scale density in the range $\\rho_{0}=10^{-2}$-$10\\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}\\ pc^{-3}}$ for each profile. What are the main differences between the two density distributions (you might use a log scale in your plots)."
