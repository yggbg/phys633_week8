# Week 4: Dark Matter Halos and Equilibria of Collisionless Systems

## Reading

- [Bovy Chapter 5](https://galaxiesbook.org/chapters/I-04.-Equilibria-of-Collisionless-Stellar-Systems.html) except 5.6
- [Bovy Sections 6.4 and 6.5](https://galaxiesbook.org/chapters/I-05.-Masses-of-Spherical-Stellar-Systems_4-The-mass-of-the-Milky-Way's-dark-matter-halo.html) (for the numerical exercise)

Note: you will need to install [galpy](https://docs.galpy.org/en/v1.11.0/) on your computer for the numerical exercise. You can do it from your rebound virtual environment with `pip install galpy`.

## Reading questions

1. What is the difference between collisionless and collisional systems?

2. (a) What are the relaxation time and dynamical time of a galaxy? (b) How can one argue that galaxies are collisionless, by comparing their two-body relaxation time with the age of the Universe?

3. (a) What's the assumption required for dynamical equilibrium, based on the virial theorem? (b) Under this assumption, what is the relation between kinetic and potential energy?

4. What is the collisionless Boltzmann equation?

5. What are the Jeans equations, and what applicability do they have for studying astronomical systems of many objects?

6. How can one physically interpret different values of the orbital anisotropy of a galaxy?

7. How can astronomical observations and the Jeans equation be used to constrain dark matter halos influences?

Answers to these questions should be submitted to your github repository *before* class on Monday.
