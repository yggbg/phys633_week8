# Week 5: Dynamical Friction

## Reading

- [Section 19.4.1](https://galaxiesbook.org/chapters/IV-03.-Hierarchical-Galaxy-Formation_4-Dynamical-processes.html#Dynamical-friction) of Bovy

- [Kirsh et al. 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Icar..199..197K/abstract) "Simulations of planet migration driven by planetesimal scattering"



## Reading questions

- Explain dynamical friction in a sentence or two.
- Why is the quantity $h(v)$ in equation (19.35) referred to as a ''potential''? In going from equation (19.35) to (19.36) an upper limit $v_M$ appears on the integral. Why?
- Equation (19.42) gives the timescale for dynamical friction to decay the orbit of a massive body of mass $M$ moving in a cluster of total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$. If you wanted to evaluate this timescale, how would you evaluate the factors $t_\mathrm{dyn}$ and $\Lambda$?
- What is the main takeaway of the Kirsh et al. paper?
- How would you calculate the location of the inner and outer edges of the feeding zone?
- What is the Hill eccentricity $e_H$ and why is it a useful quantity to look at?
- Explain the different features that can be seen in the $a$-$e_H$ plot in Figure 4.

Answers to these questions should be submitted to your github repository *before* class on Monday.
