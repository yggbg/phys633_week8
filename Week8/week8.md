# Week 8: Orbits in Disks and the Geometry of Resonance

## Reading
- Chapter 8.2 from [Murray and Dermott](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/55275B58F1A2B00FE0DB74E508E0EA68/9781139174817c8_p321-408_CBO.pdf/resonant_perturbations.pdf)
- Chapter 9.1 and 9.2 from [Jo Bovy](https://galaxiesbook.org/chapters/II-03.-Orbits-in-Disks.html) 'Dynamics and Astrophysics of Galaxies'

## Reading questions

Q1-4 are related to the first reading, Q5-7 to the second.

1. What is the behavior of the solutions of the equations of motion 9.4 and 9.5?
2. What determines the region that the orbit covers in the z-R plane?
3. What does Noether's theorem allow us to find?
4. How can one obtain a good approximation of the orbits considered in section 9.2?
5. Give a qualitative reasoning as to why the points become closer in the rotating fram for an orbit with e>0.
6. What is the difference between an interior resonance and an exterior resonance? Write mathematical expressions for both.
7. From the reading and the figures, what distinguishes a stable equilibrium configuration from an unstable equilibrium configuration?

Answers to these questions should be submitted to your github repository *before* class on Monday.
